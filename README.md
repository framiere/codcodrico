### What is github

Github manual read.

GH is a website hosting a widely used collaborative  platform. User can make and save successive iterations of the code the users work on, allowing to back it up and reverting to a previous version of the code should a bug be encountered.

Github also exists as a computer program used to work locally on code rather than with a browser, so as to be able to continue working offline.
